This folder contains the Matlab scripts of a new nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithm called the red-tailed hawk algorithm (RTH). The proposed algorithm mimics the prey-hunting method of the red-tailed hawk for solving real-world optimization problems. The RTH code includes three stages during the optimization process: 
In the high soaring stage, the red-tailed hawk explores the search space and determines the area with the prey location. 
In the low soaring stage, the red-tailed moves inside the selected area around the prey to choose the best position for the hunt. 
Then, the red-tailed swings and  hits its target in the stooping and swooping stages.
